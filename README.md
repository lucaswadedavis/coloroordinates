#Coloroordinates

Maps color-distributions in 3 space with THREE.js by projecting the red green and blue color values of each pixel in the image along the x y and z axes of a 3D color-cube.

Coloroordinates also works offline, so after you visit the site once, you can access the utility even if you're not connected to a network.
